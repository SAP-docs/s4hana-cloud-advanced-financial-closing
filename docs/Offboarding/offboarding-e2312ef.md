# Offboarding

Request the deletion of your SAP Advanced Financial Closing tenant.



## Context

If you want to delete your SAP Advanced Financial Closing tenant and your data, you need to create an incident to request the deletion. However, be aware that as a precaution against accidental deletion, the deletion process is blocked for a grace period of 60 days after you have requested the deletion.

The deletion of your tenant and your data in SAP Advanced Financial Closing covers the deletion of **all** of the following:

-   Task list templates and task lists

-   Tasks, including ongoing processes and related approvals

-   Attachments that aren't maintained in the connected communication systems

-   Configuration and business logging data


> ### Caution:  
> Once the process to unsubscribe is initiated, a resubscription is no longer possible.

If you wish to delete your tenant and your data, perform the following steps:



## Procedure

1.  Go to the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com) and create an incident under the component `FIN-FIO-FCC`.

    Once you've created the incident, a grace period of 60 days starts during which the deletion process is blocked.

2.  You're asked to confirm the intentional deletion of the tenant and that the data isn't subject to any litigation. You need to confirm this within the grace period of 60 days.

3.  Once the grace period is over and all the required information is available, the deletion process starts.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your data is subject to any litigation, the data must be retained until all legal concerns are resolved.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Once the process to unsubscribe is initiated, a resubscription is no longer possible.

## Results

Once the deletion process is completed, your tenant has been offboarded and all your data in SAP Advanced Financial Closing has been deleted. A resubscription to the same tenant isn't possible anymore.
