# *Migrate Closing Task Lists \(read-only\)*

The *Migrate Closing Task Lists \(read-only\)* app was used to migrate your financial closing task lists.



With the *Migrate Closing Task Lists \(read-only\)* app, you could previously migrate your task list templates and task lists from SAP S/4HANA Cloud for advanced financial closing as part of SAP S/4HANA Cloud. This migration included information such as notes and attachments. The app has been set to read-only with the release made available in November 2024. You can still view the migration results, but another migration is no longer possible.
