# *Migrate Configuration Data \(read-only\)*

The *Migrate Configuration Data \(read-only\)* app was used to migrate configuration data before migrating task lists.



With the *Migrate Configuration Data \(read-only\)* app, you could previously migrate your configuration data from SAP S/4HANA Cloud for advanced financial closing as part of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. This migration covered data such as users, user groups, and compliance settings. The app has been set to read-only with the release made available in November 2024. You can still view the migration results, but another migration is no longer possible.
