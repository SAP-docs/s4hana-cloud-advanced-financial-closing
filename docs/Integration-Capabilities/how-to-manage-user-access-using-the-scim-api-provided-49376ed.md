# How to Manage User Access Using the SCIM API Provided

Manage users, user groups, and user roles through a dedicated API.



<a name="loio49376ed8c58f41e0b84d141824698721__prereq_o2z_qx5_vvb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You've created an API instance and service key for API integration scenarios for SAP Advanced Financial Closing as described under [How to Create an API Instance and Service Key for API Integration Scenarios](how-to-create-an-api-instance-and-service-key-for-api-integration-scenarios-4058064.md).

-   To access the API information available from the user interface of SAP Advanced Financial Closing, your user must have a role collection assigned that includes the role template `AFC_API_Access`.




## Context

Working with the Identity Provisioning service or Identity Authentication service, you can use the SCIM API to change users, user groups, and user-to-group assignments following the SCIM standard. User role assignments are an SCIM extension. Accordingly, you can perform user-to-role assignments using the SCIM API only when you work with a custom implementation instead of the Identity Provisioning service or Identity Authentication service.

> ### Caution:  
> If you use the SCIM API, keep in mind that certain user information is case-sensitive and has to be identical between the different sources. The following user data is affected and has to be identical:
> 
> -   *User ID* in SAP Advanced Financial Closing
> 
> -   *User ID* used in the CSV upload of user data
> 
> -   *Login Name* in the identity service
> 
> -   *Subject Name Identifier* in IDP / XSUAA
> 
> 
> If this information isn't identical even though the data refers to the same user, multiple users will be maintained.

> ### Note:  
> -   Deleted users are not available through the SCIM API, even if assignments still exist in SAP Advanced Financial Closing.

> ### Restriction:  
> The following rate limits apply when using the SCIM API:
> 
> -   You can create a maximum of 10,000 requests per hour.
> 
> -   You can create a maximum of three requests at the same time.



### Different Means to Manage User Access

In SAP Advanced Financial Closing, you have different means to manage specific aspects of user access:

-   Manage user access in SAP Advanced Financial Closing directly.
-   Manage user access through an identity provider.
-   Manage user access using the SCIM API provided.

Some of these different means to manage user access offer a subset of available functions. Additionally, when using the SCIM API provided, you need to pay attention to the following effects:

-   You can't synchronize a user group using the SCIM API if a draft already exists for this user group in SAP Advanced Financial Closing. You may find corresponding error messages in the synchronization log.
-   A user group that has been synchronized using the SCIM API becomes a read-only group in SAP Advanced Financial Closing. However, you can reactivate the *Edit* function in SAP Advanced Financial Closing by choosing *Reactivate Edit Function* for the affected group in the *Manage User Groups* app.

    > ### Note:  
    > After another synchronization through the SCIM API, the changes you made in SAP Advanced Financial Closing after reactivating the *Edit* function will be overwritten and the group will become read-only again.

-   Ensure that you don't synchronize empty user groups using the SCIM API, since users may be able to assign these groups to objects in SAP Advanced Financial Closing.

> ### Tip:  
> To have a better overview of the source of a user or user group, you can add the *Source* column to the lists in the *Manage Users* app and in the *Manage User Groups* app.



## Procedure

1.  **Optional:** Maintain the API information for your source system:

    As a source system, you can use an identity authentication, for example. To do this, follow the steps described under [SAP Advanced Financial Closing \(Identity Provisioning documentation for source systems\)](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-provisioning/identity-provisioning/sap-s-4hana-cloud-for-advanced-financial-closing).

    > ### Note:  
    > Other identity provisioning services may require a different configuration.

2.  Maintain the API information for your target system as described under [SAP Advanced Financial Closing \(Identity Provisioning documentation for target systems\)](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-provisioning/identity-provisioning/target-sap-s-4hana-cloud-for-advanced-financial-closing).

    Some of the information you need to provide may be sensitive data for which security recommendations apply. For more information, see [Data Used for API Integrations](../Security/data-used-for-api-integrations-62f0a49.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > The steps described in the documentation refer to Identity Provisioning provided by [SAP Cloud Identity Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_PROVISIONING/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/2d2685d469a54a56b886105a06ccdae6.html).
    > 
    > Other identity provisioning services may require a different configuration.

    > ### Remember:  
    > The login name of a user maintained in Identity Provisioning has to be identical to the user ID in SAP Advanced Financial Closing.

3.  **Optional:** After you've configured the source and target system information, you can also use runs in Identity Provisioning to synchronize users and user groups:

    1.  Go to the *Source System Details* menu.

    2.  Go to the *Jobs* tab.

    3.  Choose *Run Now* or *Schedule* for the corresponding action.

    4.  Once the run is finished, you can find the results under the *Job Execution Details* menu.


4.  Using the API documentation provided by the user interface of SAP Advanced Financial Closing, you can now use the API to manage user access:

    1.  From SAP Advanced Financial Closing, open the *Public API* app.

    2.  Open *SCIM*.

    3.  On the next screen, you find all the information needed for this API.

        > ### Note:  
        > The API follows SCIM standards 7644 and 7643. However, it has been extended by functions that you can use to manage user roles, that is, adding users to roles or removing users from them.
