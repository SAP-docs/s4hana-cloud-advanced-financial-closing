# Data Protection and Privacy

Data protection is associated with numerous legal requirements and privacy concerns. In addition to compliance with general data protection and privacy acts, it is necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries. SAP provides specific features and functions to support compliance with regard to relevant legal requirements, including data protection. SAP does not give any advice on whether these features and functions are the best method to support company, industry, regional, or country-specific requirements. Furthermore, this information should not be taken as advice or a recommendation regarding additional features that would be required in specific IT environments. Decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements.

> ### Note:  
> SAP does not provide legal advice in any form. SAP software supports data protection compliance by providing security features and specific data protection-relevant functions, such as simplified blocking and deletion of personal data. In many cases, compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws will not be covered by a product feature. Definitions and other terms used in this document are not taken from a particular legal source.

> ### Caution:  
> The extent to which data protection is supported by technical means depends on secure system operation. Network security, security note implementation, adequate logging of system changes, and appropriate usage of the system are the basic technical requirements for compliance with data privacy legislation and other legislation.
