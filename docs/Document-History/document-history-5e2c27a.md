-   [User Management](../User-Management/user-management-ae7fa30.md):

    Due to the final switch to the new authorization concept and the retiring of the old concept, the following changes were applied:

    -   **User Access Management \(New Authorization Concept\)** was renamed to [User Access Management](../User-Management/user-access-management-d974847.md).

        Authorizations that were granted for compatibility reasons are no longer listed, since they no longer apply in the new authorization concept.
