-   [User Management](../User-Management/user-management-ae7fa30.md):

    Due to the final switch to the new authorization concept and the retiring of the old concept, the following changes were applied:

    -   **User Access Management \(New Authorization Concept\)** was renamed to [User Access Management](../User-Management/user-access-management-d974847.md).

    -   [Extended What's New: Switch of Authorization Concept](../User-Management/extended-what-s-new-switch-of-authorization-concept-3155ba8.md) was added to provide you with detailed information about the consequences of this switch.

        Authorizations that were granted for compatibility reasons are no longer listed, since they no longer apply in the new authorization concept.

    -   **User Access Management \(Old Authorization Concept\)** and all its underlying pages have been removed.
