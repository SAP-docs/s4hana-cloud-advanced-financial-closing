## Prerequisites

Your user must have a role collection assigned that includes the role template `AFC_UserManagement`.

For more information about role templates, see [How to Manage Static Role Templates](How_to_Manage_Static_Role_Templates_0cca34d.md).



## Context

The user roles you've created take effect only once you assign users to them. Users who have no user role assigned don't have access to any data unless theyâ€™re maintained as a user responsible or processing user or as a substitute.



## Procedure

1.  Go to the *Manage User Role Assignments* app.

2.  Decide in which direction you want to make the assignment:

    -   To assign users to a specific user role, go to the *User Roles* tab and select a user role.
    -   To assign user roles to a specific user, go to the *Users* tab and select a user.
3.  Choose *Add* and select the users or user roles you want to assign.
