# Automated Setup

Booster in SAP BTP cockpit for automated setup of SAP Advanced Financial Closing



<a name="loio08b54863254c43fda04b0726814e5506__section_v51_vqj_pdc"/>

## Context

For SAP Advanced Financial Closing, a booster is available in the SAP BTP cockpit. This booster supports you with your initial system setup by automating several of the setup steps. The following steps can be covered by the booster:

-   Create or select the SAP BTP subaccount that you want to use for SAP Advanced Financial Closing.
-   Initial role template assignments for users, such as administrators, developers, and business users.
-   Create formations for communication systems of type SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.

    > ### Note:  
    > An automated formation setup is currently possible for systems of type SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition only.
    > 
    > The system needs to have been registered under *System Landscape* \> *Systems* in your subaccount before you can use the booster. The communication scenario group needs to be set as either *All Communication Scenarios* or *Integration with SAP Advanced Financial Closing*. The registration happened either automatically or it had to be done manually. For more information, see [Registering an SAP System \(SAP BTP documentation\)](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/2ffdaff0f1454acdb046876045321c91.html).

    2.  In the *Include Systems* section, under *SAP S/4HANA Cloud System*, select the communication system you already want to connect to SAP Advanced Financial Closing.
