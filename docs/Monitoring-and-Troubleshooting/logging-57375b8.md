## Change Log

The *Change Log* app shows you as a business user a change history of closing tasks, task lists, and templates.

You can see what was changed or deleted, by whom, and when. You can filter by *Type of Change* \(*Delete*, *Insert*, or *Change*\). And you can filter for changes made to a particular template, task list, or closing task or by a particular user.

For more information about using this app, see [Change Log](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b3f5b9cf1ab7498fad5b6f297013d65a/SHIP/en-US/e08df37697ed4d8c8b3e4826c203dc6e.html "") :arrow_upper_right:.
