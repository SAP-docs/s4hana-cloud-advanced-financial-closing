# Legal Basis for Data Processing





### What personal data does SAP Advanced Financial Closing process?

The solution doesn't deliver any functions primarily concerned with processing personal data. SAP Advanced Financial Closing processes user-identifying data only in order to authenticate users, to display \(error\) messages, and to write audit logs of business-relevant or security-relevant events.

The following data is processed:

-   User ID

-   User's full name

-   Contact information, for example, phone number, email address, and department


> ### Tip:  
> If an email address is entered as the user ID in the identity provider, this email address is displayed in audit logs and messages. Since email addresses may disclose personal data and enable other users to easily identify the identity of a user, itâ€™s recommended to use a pseudonym as the user ID in the identity provider, for example, a GUID.



### What is the legal basis for data processing by SAP?

SAP processes personal data in SAP Advanced Financial Closing as a subprocessor for SAP's cloud customers. Therefore, SAP acts as a processor according to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) Article 28. The legal basis for processing by SAP's customers, who are the data controllers, has to be ensured by the customers themselves.
