# Deletion of Personal Data



## Simplified Blocking and Deletion

The processing of personal data is subject to applicable laws related to the deletion of this data when the specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for processing this personal data has expired. If there is no longer a legitimate purpose, that requires the retention and use of personal data, it must be deleted irrecoverably. Blocking is necessary when the original retention period has expired but additional applicable extended and overruling \(mandated by law\) retention periods are still in place. After the expiration of the longest retention period, the data must be deleted.



## Deletion of Personal Data

When considering compliance with data protection regulations, it is also necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries. A typical potential scenario in certain countries is that personal data shall be deleted after the specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for the processing of personal data has ended, but only if no other retention periods are defined in legislation, for example, retention periods for financial documents. Legal requirements in certain scenarios or countries also often require blocking of data in cases where the specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes for the processing of this data have ended, however, the data still has to be retained in the database due to other legally mandated retention periods. Sometimes, transactional data are personal data with relation to a master data object, e.g. a sales order with reference to a business partner. Therefore, the challenge for deletion and blocking is first to handle transactional data and finally other data, such as business partner data.
