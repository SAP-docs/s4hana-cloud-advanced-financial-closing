1.  Open the *Monitor Communication Systems* app.

2.  From the table, open the system details of a communication system.

3.  Go to the *Notifications* section.

4.  In the *Assigned Scenarios* table, you can see which user or user group is defined for the respective scenario.

## How Can I Receive Notifications?

Since notification recipients are defined in the *Specify Communication Systems* app, you need to contact one of your system administrators so they can assign you to one or more scenarios for the corresponding communication system.

If you're a system administrator yourself, you can set up notifications as described under [How to Set Up Notifications About Communication System Errors](how-to-set-up-notifications-about-communication-system-errors-835b2a2.md).
