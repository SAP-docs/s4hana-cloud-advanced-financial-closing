## Overview

SAP S/4HANA Cloud for advanced financial closing is a cloud-based hub and can be connected to multiple system instances called communication systems. Therefore, advanced financial closing is only **one instance**. There is no separation into different instances for Dev, Q, and P system.



### Content

All access and reporting can be controlled for each communication system individually.

Task list templates and task lists are created for specific communication systems and can't be transported to other communication systems. Nodes within the closing structure are assigned to a specific communication system upon creation. The assignment can't be changed later on.
