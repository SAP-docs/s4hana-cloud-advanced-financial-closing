## Context

> ### Remember:  
> In company code groups, you group company codes that can be defined by the same value for a specific grouping characteristic. You create them within **one specific** characteristic.
> 
> Grouping characteristics define by which characteristic you want to group company codes. SAP Advanced Financial Closing offers four grouping characteristics. What each characteristic represents, however, is defined by your company.

4.  On the new screen, provide a name and description for your company code group.

    For example, for a group within the characteristic *Region*, you can enter a region, such as `North`, `East`, `South`, or `West`.

5.  Choose *Create* to confirm.

6.  **Optional:** In the company code group, you can still edit the name and description by choosing *Edit General Information*.

7.  Under *Assigned Company Codes*, choose *Add* in the table toolbar.

8.  Select the company codes you want to assign to this group within the selected characteristic.

9.  Choose *Add* to confirm.

10. **Optional:** If you ever need to remove a company code from this group, open the company code group, select the company code in the table, and choose *Delete*.
