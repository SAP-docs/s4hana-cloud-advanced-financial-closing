## About This Scope



### Apps in This Scope

-   *Manage Task Models*




### System Dependency of Roles

User roles created for this scope are **always system-independent** because they don't have to be restricted to just one communication system. You can, however, limit this user role to task models in one or more communication systems by creating a restricted user role.



### Restrictions

User roles created for this scope can be restricted or unrestricted.

For restricted roles, access is granted based on **communication systems** you assign to the user role. This means that you restrict the access to task models in the specified communication systems.
