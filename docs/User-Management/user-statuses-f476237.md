> ### Note:  
> To avoid the reactivation of a deleted user through a new logon via the IdP, you also need to unassign the user from all role collections **relevant for SAP S/4HANA Cloud for advanced financial closing**. This way, access to all apps for advanced financial closing is revoked. You can delete the user from role collections using the SAP BTP cockpit. For more information, see [Delete Users from Role Collections](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/4f8a242839a947f9a6f379650480c776.html).
