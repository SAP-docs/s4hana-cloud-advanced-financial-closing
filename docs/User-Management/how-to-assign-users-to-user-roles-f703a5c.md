# How to Assign Users to User Roles

Specify the users to whom the user roles you've created apply.



<a name="loiof703a5c6ee0a4fda9f565a67d49d35b7__prereq_n3m_51c_ckb"/>

## Prerequisites

Your user must have a role collection assigned that includes one of the following role templates:

-   `AFC_UserManagement`

-   `AFC_UserAdmin`


For more information about role templates, see [How to Manage Static Role Templates](how-to-manage-static-role-templates-0cca34d.md).



## Context

The user roles you've created take effect only once you assign users to them. Users who have no user role assigned don't have access to any data unless theyâ€™re maintained as a user responsible or processing user or as a substitute.

> ### Note:  
> A substitute of an owner, a user responsible, or a processing user doesn't inherit role assignments. Accordingly, substitutes may need to be assigned to the same user roles as the owners, users responsible, or processing users they're substituting for.



## Procedure

1.  Go to the *Manage User Role Assignments* app.

2.  Decide how you want to perform the assignment:

    1.  You can perform single assignments. There are two ways to do this:

        -   To assign users to a specific user role, go to the *User Roles* tab and select a user role.

            -   Choose *Add* and select the users you want to assign.


        -   To assign user roles to a specific user, go to the *Users* tab and select a user.

            -   Choose *Add* and select the user roles you want to assign.



    2.  You can perform a batch assignment by uploading a CSV file that lists the assignments:

        1.  Go to the *User-to-Role Assignments* tab.

        2.  Download the template to ensure the file has the correct format for the upload.

            > ### Note:  
            > The upload has to be a CSV file with UTF-8 encoding.

        3.  Fill out the template. Add only one role and one user in each row. You can update several roles and several users with one CSV file.

            > ### Caution:  
            > The user ID is case-sensitive. Use the same spelling as in your identity provider.

            > ### Note:  
            > You need to use the exact role names for the assignment to work.

        4.  Save the template.

        5.  On the *User-to-Role Assignments* tab, choose *Upload Assignments*.

        6.  Select your file and upload it.



3.  To get an overview of the user-to-role assignments, go to the *User-to-Role Assignments* tab.

    1.  You can download this overview using the export options in the top-right corner.

## Results

The users you've just updated now have access to the data to which the user role grants access.
