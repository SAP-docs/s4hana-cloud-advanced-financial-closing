# How to Manage Static Role Templates

Define and bundle static roles and assign them to users.



<a name="loio0cca34d98080443b8ce7294e9b4977b4__prereq_gq2_n3n_sjb"/>

## Prerequisites

1.  You've performed onboarding.

    For more information, see [Onboarding](../Onboarding/onboarding-1987953.md).

2.  You've established trust and federation with the UAA.

    For more information, see [Trust and Federation with Identity Providers](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/cb1bc8f1bd5c482e891063960d7acd78.html).

## Context

As a prerequisite for assigning roles to IdP users or user groups, you also need to configure role collections. A role collection consists of one or more roles from one or more applications and can be used to bundle authorizations within and across applications.

For more information about how to create roles and how to bundle them in role collections using the SAP BTP cockpit, see [Building Roles and Role Collections for Applications](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/eaa6a26291914b348e875a00b6beb729.html).

> ### Caution:  
> Users to whom you assign a static role for system administration, configuration, user management, or compliance can read and change all data in the respective apps. For other apps, access must be granted before users can read and change data. For more information, see [User Access Management](user-access-management-d974847.md).

## Procedure

1.  Familiarize yourself with the available role templates that are described under [Static Roles for Advanced Financial Closing](static-roles-for-advanced-financial-closing-b92a241.md).

2.  Additionally, decide whether you want to use the available composite role templates.


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Role Template


    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Included Role Templates


    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    `AFC_Expert`


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    -   `AFC_Define`
    -   `AFC_Config`


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    `AFC_Manager`


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    -   `AFC_Reporting`
    -   `AFC_Approve`
    -   `AFC_UserManagement`


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
3.  Create role collections from the role templates provided by advanced financial closing. Follow the steps under [Maintain Role Collections](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/d5f1612d8230448bb6c02a7d9c8ac0d1.html).

    > ### Caution:  
    > To ensure a separation of concerns, you might want to avoid combining the role templates `AFC_Define` and `AFC_Process` into one role collection.

    > ### Note:  
    > When creating role collections, keep in mind that an app may link to objects in another app. For example, the *Closing Task Completion* app links to tasks in the *Process Closing Tasks* app. You can create a role collection that includes the role template `AFC_Reporting` but not the role template `AFC_Process`. However, users with this role collection won't be able to follow the link to the task details in the *Process Closing Tasks* app.

4.  Assign role collections to users. Follow the steps under [Mapping Role Collections in the Subaccount](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/9e1bf57130ef466e8017eab298b40e5e.html).

5.  Add roles to role collections. Follow the steps under [Add Roles to Role Collections on the Application Level](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/7596a0bdab4649ac8a6f6721dc72db19.html).
