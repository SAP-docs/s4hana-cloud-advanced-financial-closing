# How to Grant Access to Specific Objects

Grant access to specific task list templates, task lists, or tasks by assigning one or more authorizations available within this scope.



<a name="loio1d6de4177efd46eab7dc83ad456cf53a__prereq_hx5_kzj_qrb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   Your user must have a role collection assigned that includes one of the following role templates or role template combinations:

    -   `AFC_Config`

    -   `AFC_UserRoles`

    -   `AFC_UserRolesSingleApp` and `AFC_AuthGroupsApp`


    For more information about role templates, see [How to Manage Static Role Templates](how-to-manage-static-role-templates-0cca34d.md).

-   You've familiarized yourself with the information under [Task Processing Scope](task-processing-scope-b4f8ec6.md) to ensure that you're using the right means to grant access.




## Context

You can grant access that is restricted to specific task list template, task lists, or tasks. The authorizations you select for this user role then only apply to templates, task lists, and tasks to which the selected authorization groups are assigned. The following graphics explain the relationship between the aspects involved:

The abstraction level between user roles and specific objects enables you to grant access to collections of objects, for example, according to the domain of expertise.

> ### Example:

## Procedure

1.  Open the *Configuration* app and choose *Authorization Groups*.

2.  Choose *Create* in the table toolbar.

3.  Provide the following information:

    1.  Under *Name*, freely define a name for your authorization group.

    2.  Under *Applied To*, select one of the following:

        -   *Task List Template / Task List* to grant access to task list templates or task lists.

        -   *Task* to grant access to tasks.


    3.  Under *Description*, you can add a description for your authorization group.


4.  Save.

5.  Go back to the *Configuration* app and choose *User Roles*.

6.  Go to the *Scoped User Roles* tab.

7.  Choose *Create* in the table toolbar.

8.  Provide the following information:

    1.  Under *Name*, freely define a name for your user role.

    2.  Under *Description*, you can add a description for your user role.

    3.  Under *Scope*, select *Task Processing*.

    4.  Under *Type*, select *System-Independent*.

    5.  Under *Restriction*, select *Restricted*.


9.  Choose *Create* in the dialog footer. The user role is created and opened right away.

10. Under *Authorizations*, choose *Add* and select an authorization you want to add.

    > ### Note:  
    > A user role must have at least one authorization assigned.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Users who have this role assignment have the authorizations across all task list templates and task lists.

    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    > ### Note:  
    > The *Read* authorization will automatically be added if you add another authorization before adding *Read*.

11. Repeat the previous step to assign additional authorizations.

12. To remove an authorization, choose the corresponding *Delete* icon :x:.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Some authorizations include others. When removing authorizations, you need to start with the broader authorization, since the included authorization is a minimum for the broader one.

13. Under *Task Lists* and *Tasks*, add the authorization group you created before for the respective object type.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can add several authorization groups if the selected authorizations need to be applied to several authorization groups. Keep in mind that all users who have this role assignment have access to **all objects** that these authorization groups are assigned to on task list level.

14. Whenever you made a change to a user role, choose *Activate* in the header.

    This activates the user role and, if users were already assigned, this also synchronizes any changes with the users assigned.

## Results

You have now created a user role within the scope *Task Processing* for access restricted to task list templates, task lists, and tasks that have the selected authorization groups assigned.

## Next Steps

Grant users this access by assigning them to the user role or the role to them. For more information, see [How to Assign Users to User Roles](how-to-assign-users-to-user-roles-f703a5c.md).
