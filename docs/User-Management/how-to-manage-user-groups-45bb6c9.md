# How to Manage User Groups

A user group represents a group of users who can be assigned to a particular set of closing tasks.



<a name="loio45bb6c91e94a4d3bafbf4b752c918c3e__prereq_q22_x4m_3kb"/>

## Prerequisites

Your user must have a role collection assigned that includes one of the following role templates:

-   `AFC_Config`

-   `AFC_UserAdmin`

-   `AFC_UserGroupsApp`


For more information about role templates, see [How to Manage Static Role Templates](how-to-manage-static-role-templates-0cca34d.md) and [Static Roles for SAP Advanced Financial Closing](static-roles-for-sap-advanced-financial-closing-b92a241.md).



## Context

In the *Manage Closing Task Lists* app, task lists, tasks, or folders can be assigned to user groups instead of individual users. This setting has the following effects:

-   When you monitor and report on tasks using the *Financial Close Overview* and the *Closing Task Completion* apps, the names of the users assigned to tasks are not visible. Instead, you can only see the user group name that the user belongs to.

-   Notifications from the task list are sent to the users of the assigned user group.

-   In the *Process Closing Tasks* app, users assigned to a user group can see all tasks their group is assigned to as processing user group or as responsible user group.




### Different Means to Manage User Access

In SAP Advanced Financial Closing, you have different means to manage specific aspects of user access:

-   Manage user access in SAP Advanced Financial Closing directly.
-   Manage user access through an identity provider.
-   Manage user access using the SCIM API provided.

Some of these different means to manage user access offer a subset of available functions. Additionally, when using the SCIM API provided, you need to pay attention to the following effects:

-   You can't synchronize a user group using the SCIM API if a draft already exists for this user group in SAP Advanced Financial Closing. You may find corresponding error messages in the synchronization log.
-   A user group that has been synchronized using the SCIM API becomes a read-only group in SAP Advanced Financial Closing. However, you can reactivate the *Edit* function in SAP Advanced Financial Closing by choosing *Reactivate Edit Function* for the affected group in the *Manage User Groups* app.

    > ### Note:  
    > After another synchronization through the SCIM API, the changes you made in SAP Advanced Financial Closing after reactivating the *Edit* function will be overwritten and the group will become read-only again.

-   Ensure that you don't synchronize empty user groups using the SCIM API, since users may be able to assign these groups to objects in SAP Advanced Financial Closing.

> ### Tip:  
> To have a better overview of the source of a user or user group, you can add the *Source* column to the lists in the *Manage Users* app and in the *Manage User Groups* app.



## Procedure

1.  Go to the *Configuration* app and choose *User Groups* from the table.

3.  To create several new user groups at once, perform the following steps:

    1.  Go to the *User Groups* tab.

    2.  Download the template from the table toolbar.

    3.  In the CSV file, enter the user groups you want to create and for each group, enter one user that will be assigned to the group upon creation.

        > ### Note:  
        > Provide each user group only **once** and assign only one user to it. You can assign several users in one batch to the user group once it has been created.

    4.  Go back to the *Manage User Groups* app.

    5.  On the *User Groups* tab, choose *Upload User Groups* in the table toolbar.

    6.  Choose *Add* and select the CSV file you've prepared.

    7.  Choose *Upload* in the dialog footer.

4.  To assign several users in one batch to user groups, perform the following steps:

    1.  Go to the *User-to-Group Assignments* tab.

    2.  Download the template from the table toolbar.

    3.  In the CSV file, enter the assignments you want to upload.

        > ### Note:  
        > On each line, you provide only one user group and only one user. However, you can mention each user group and user several times. This means that you can use this template to assign several users to several user groups in one batch.

    4.  Go back to the *Manage User Groups* app.

    5.  On the *User-to-Group Assignments* tab, choose *Upload Assignments* in the table toolbar.

    6.  Choose *Add* and select the CSV file you've prepared.

## Results

-   All users who belong to an owner group or to a responsible or processing user group of an object automatically have access to that object.

    > ### Caution:  
    > The substitutes of the users assigned to this user group don't inherit access to the objects.

-   You can get an overview of the assignments of users to user groups on the *User-to-Group Assignments* tab.

    > ### Tip:  
    > Using column-specific filters, you can enter specific criteria for your search.
    > 
    > Additionally, you can group entries by specific criteria using the *Group* option that you can find in the settings for this table.

    To export the overview, you can use the *Export to Spreadsheet* icon <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î€´</span> on the table toolbar.
