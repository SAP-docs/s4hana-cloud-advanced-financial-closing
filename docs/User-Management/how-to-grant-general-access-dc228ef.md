# How to Grant General Access

Grant general access by assigning one or more authorizations available within this scope.



<a name="loiodc228efd150d4e30b5891f9a65db318f__prereq_drt_ws3_qrb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   Your user must have a role collection assigned that includes one of the following role templates:

    -   `AFC_Config`

    -   `AFC_UserRoles`

    -   `AFC_UserRolesSingleApp`


    For more information about role templates, see [How to Manage Static Role Templates](how-to-manage-static-role-templates-0cca34d.md) and [Static Roles for SAP Advanced Financial Closing](static-roles-for-sap-advanced-financial-closing-b92a241.md).

-   You've familiarized yourself with the information under [Task List Creation Scope](task-list-creation-scope-ba4100e.md) to ensure that you're using the right means to grant access.




## Context

You can grant access that applies to all objects within the scope, independently of the related communication system or authorization groups. However, you can still decide which authorizations to grant. This means that even though user access isn't restricted to specific objects, general access doesn't necessarily mean that users can perform all actions on task list templates and task lists.

> ### Example:  
> **Quick Demo: General Access Within the Task List Creation Scope**
> 
> The following quick demo shows how to create a user role within the *Task List Creation* scope granting general *Create* access by performing the steps described below:
> 
> > ### Note:

> > 
> > Interfaces may differ slightly depending on the version of your apps.



## Procedure

1.  Open the *Configuration* app and choose *User Roles*.

2.  Go to the *Scoped User Roles* tab.

3.  Choose *Create* in the table toolbar.

4.  Provide the following information:

    1.  Under *Name*, freely define a name for your user role.

    2.  Under *Description*, you can add a description for your user role.

    3.  Under *Scope*, select *Task List Creation*.

    4.  *Type* \(read-only\):

        For scope *Task List Creation*, this is always *System-Independent*.

    5.  Under *Restriction*, select *Unrestricted*.


5.  Choose *Create* in the dialog footer. The user role is created and opened right away.

6.  Under *Authorizations*, choose *Add* and select an authorization you want to add.

    > ### Note:  
    > A user role must have at least one authorization assigned.

    > ### Remember:  
    > For users who have this role assignment, the authorizations selected apply across all task list templates and task lists.

    <td valign="top">
    
    Authorization to create and copy task list templates. This authorization always includes *Read* authorization.

    This authorization can't be assigned to restricted user roles.

    *Delete*

    *Write*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Authorization to edit task list templates and task lists. Additionally, authorization to delete task list templates and non-released task lists. This authorization always includes *Read* authorization and *User Assignment* authorization.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Generate*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Authorization to generate task lists and change the status of task lists. This authorization always includes *Read* authorization.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *User Assignment*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Authorization to change processing users or user groups, and users responsible or responsible user groups within the scope of this user role. This authorization allows changes **only through quick actions**. This authorization always includes *Read* authorization.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    > ### Note:  
    > The *Read* authorization will automatically be added if you add another authorization before adding *Read*.

7.  Choose *Add* in the dialog footer.

8.  Repeat the previous steps to assign additional authorizations.

9.  To remove an authorization, choose the corresponding *Delete* icon :x:.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Some authorizations include others. When removing authorizations, you need to start with the broader authorization, since the included authorization is a minimum for the broader one.

10. Whenever you made a change to a user role, choose *Activate* in the header.

    This activates the user role and, if users were already assigned, this also synchronizes any changes with the users assigned.
