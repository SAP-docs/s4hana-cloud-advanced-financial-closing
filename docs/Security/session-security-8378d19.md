## Session Security Protection

Session security protection is handled as described in the programming model provided by the User Account and Authentication \(UAA\) component. For more information, see [Web Access Control](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/70a62d12cf91493cb9d1ec3c04d19ff9.html?locale=en-US).

## Session Timeout

The session timeout in SAP S/4HANA Cloud for advanced financial closing is set to the maximum possible for SAP Fiori applications, meaning that sessions time out after **20 minutes** of inactivity. Users are then automatically signed out and need to sign in again to start a new session.
