# User Administration, Authentication, and Authorizations

Consider the following user management best practices:

-   Grant users only the minimum level of authorization that they need for their work. For example, a business user should not be granted authorization as administrator.

-   Ensure that authorizations are removed as soon as they're no longer needed, for example, when an employee leaves the company.
