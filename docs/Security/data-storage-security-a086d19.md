# Data Storage Security

To find out more about data storage in the Cloud Foundry environment, go to the [SAP HANA Cloud Getting Started Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud/sap-hana-cloud-getting-started-guide/sap-hana-cloud-getting-started-guide).

We apply the following data storage security measures:

-   Transport: SSL/TLS

-   SAP HANA data encryption services

    For more information, on the SAP Help Portal under [SAP HANA Platform](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM), search for Server-Side Data Encryption Services.

-   Tenants are encrypted separately.


Files, such as attachments, are stored in Object Store. For more information, see the SAP Help Portal under [Object Store on SAP BTP](https://help.sap.com/docs/ObjectStore).
