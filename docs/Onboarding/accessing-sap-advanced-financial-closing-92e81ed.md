# Accessing SAP Advanced Financial Closing

Access SAP Advanced Financial Closing under one of two domains.



<a name="loio92e81ed38757493ca89484bd99e21ab0__section_ygf_pdj_kbc"/>

## Context

You can access SAP Advanced Financial Closing under two different domains. The **default URL** for accessing the SAP Advanced Financial Closing launchpad is determined during the subscription of your tenant. Depending on when your tenant was subscribed, your default URL follows one of the following patterns:

-   For subscriptions as of June 23, 2024, the domain pattern is as follows:

    `<subdomain>.production.<region>.afc.cloud.sap`

-   For subscriptions prior to June 23, 2024, the domain pattern is as follows:

    `<subdomain>.production-afc-sap.cfapps.<region>.hana.ondemand.com`


Independent of your default URL, the SAP Advanced Financial Closing launchpad is always accessible with either pattern.

Emails sent from SAP Advanced Financial Closing use the default URL. In most cases, the secondary URL isn't relevant for you.

## Relevance of the Domain Distinction

The distinction between the `afc.cloud.sap` domain and the `hana.ondemand.com` domain can become relevant in certain integration scenarios. Due to the upcoming deprecation of third-party cookie support by browser vendors, the navigation flow between integrated applications may be interrupted if the domains used by the two products differ.

> ### Example:  
> If you've set up integration with SAP Build Work Zone, you need to ensure that your default URL for SAP Advanced Financial Closing uses the same domain as your SAP Build Work Zone instance.
> 
> For more information specifically about domain handling in SAP Build Work Zone, see [Using the Common Super Domain](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-standard-edition/sap-build-work-zone-standard-edition/using-super-common-domain?locale=en-US) in the SAP Build Work Zone documentation.
