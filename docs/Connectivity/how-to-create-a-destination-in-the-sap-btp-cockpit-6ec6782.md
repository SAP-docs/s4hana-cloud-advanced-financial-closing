## Prerequisites

-   You have already completed the onboarding process as described under [Onboarding](../Onboarding/onboarding-1987953.md).

-   To connect to your SAP ERP system, you need to have installed and configured the Cloud Connector. For more information, see [How to Install and Configure the Cloud Connector](how-to-install-and-configure-the-cloud-connector-3d19a8a.md).

-   To connect to your SAP ERP system, you require the SAP ERP connector for SAP Advanced Financial Closing. For more information, see [How to Set Up the SAP ERP Connector](how-to-set-up-the-sap-erp-connector-b139d1e.md).

-   The SAP ERP system administrator needs to have provided you with the following information:

    -   Back-end URL for the communication system

    -   The technical communication user with the authorization objects mentioned in the SAP ERP connector for SAP Advanced Financial Closing documentation. For more information, see [Security Considerations](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP_CONNECTOR_FOR_ADVANCED_FINANCIAL_CLOSING/c56f7dab0ed341afad9581be5651184f/c552f0649acd42a7bb8638359ca82897.html).





## Procedure

1.  Open your SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Create a destination in your SAP BTP cockpit. For more information, see [Managing Destinations](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/84e45e071c7646c88027fffc6a7bb787.html).
