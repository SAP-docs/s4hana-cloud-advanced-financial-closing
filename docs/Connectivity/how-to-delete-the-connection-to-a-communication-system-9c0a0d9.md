## Prerequisites

-   Your user must have a role collection assigned that includes one of the following role templates:

    -   `AFC_SystemAdmin`

    -   `AFC_SpecifySystemsApp`


    For more information about role templates, see [How to Manage Static Role Templates](../User-Management/how-to-manage-static-role-templates-0cca34d.md) and [Static Roles for SAP Advanced Financial Closing](../User-Management/static-roles-for-sap-advanced-financial-closing-b92a241.md).

-   The connection to a communication system can be removed only if it isn't referenced by any task list template, task list, user role, or company code group.

## Results

You have now deleted the connection between SAP Advanced Financial Closing and the selected communication system.

> ### Note:  
> Deleting the connection between the communication system and SAP Advanced Financial Closing doesn't delete the destination on the SAP BTP. If you want to delete the SAP BTP destination as well, you need to do this in the SAP BTP cockpit.
