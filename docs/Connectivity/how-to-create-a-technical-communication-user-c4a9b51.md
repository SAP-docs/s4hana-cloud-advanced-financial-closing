# How to Create a Technical Communication User

Create a technical communication user for your SAP S/4HANA system.



<a name="loioc4a9b51a49c5411eadeb7f7208b6b9cc__section_i4b_gbw_gsb"/>

## Context

You need to create a technical communication user with specific authorizations to enable the connection between advanced financial closing and the communication system. The required authorizations can't be granted by assigning the technical communication user to a `SAPALL` profile. Instead, the technical communication user needs to have a specific `PFCG` role assigned as described here.
