# How to Configure Local Settings in Communication Systems

Configure your local settings for better use with advanced financial closing.

When using SAP S/4HANA Cloud for advanced financial closing, you want to include your customer-specific local settings and ABAP programs. You can include them without any changes by registering them for advanced financial closing. However, to fully benefit from the automatic task status reporting to advanced financial closing, you need to integrate your programs and local settings further.

For more information about how to configure ABAP programs and your local settings in your communication system, see the local settings guide that is added as an attachment to SAP Note [2873915](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2873915). The local settings guide covers the following configuration steps:

1.  Registering ABAP programs for use in advanced financial closing

2.  Registering SAP Fiori applications for use in advanced financial closing

3.  Differences in local settings between SAP ERP and SAP S/4HANA releases
