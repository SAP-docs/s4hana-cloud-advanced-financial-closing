## Use

The connection allows you to do the following, for example:

-   In the *Manage Closing Task Lists* app:

    -   You can assign communication systems to your task list templates. Business attributes, such as the factory calendar or ledger, are then governed by the financial communication system specified and are incorporated into the task list template.


-   In the *Process Closing Tasks* app:

    -   When you process tasks of type *SAP Fiori Application* in a task list defined for the respective communication system, youâ€™re automatically forwarded to the app in the respective system's launchpad.

        > ### Note:  
        > If the closing business transaction type refers to a transaction and not to a semantic object and action, you automatically navigate to the transaction rendered as html GUI. In this case, the following rules apply:
        > 
        > -   The Internet Transaction Server \(ITS\) has to be active in your communication system. This is set up by default.
        > 
        > -   The user processing the task needs to have a user in the communication system and be authenticated, ideally using single sign-on \(SSO\).
        > 
        > -   Context parameters such as fiscal year, fiscal year period and company code are **not** handed over to the target window.


    -   When you process tasks of type *Job* that are run in the communication system, the status and results of these scheduling jobs are returned to SAP S/4HANA Cloud for advanced financial closing. You can see the details for each task in the *Monitor Business Logs* app. For more information, see [Logging](../Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting/logging-57375b8.md).
