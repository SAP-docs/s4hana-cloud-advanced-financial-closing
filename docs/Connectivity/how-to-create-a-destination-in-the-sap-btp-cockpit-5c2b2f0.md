## Procedure

1.  Open your SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Create a destination. For more information, see [Managing Destinations](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/84e45e071c7646c88027fffc6a7bb787.html).

    Enter the following information in the destination configuration:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    <td valign="top">
    
    Specify a name for the destination configuration.

    <tr>
    <td valign="top">

    Enter the back-end URL of the communication system that you've received from the system administrator. Make sure to add the SAP client number at the end of the URL. Accordingly, the back-end URL has to have the following format:

    The highlighted part is the same for all SAP S/4HANA systems.
