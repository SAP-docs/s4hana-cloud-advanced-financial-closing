# Deletion of Personal Data



## Simplified Blocking and Deletion

When considering compliance with data protection regulations, it is also necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries. A typical potential scenario in certain countries is that personal data shall be deleted after the specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for the processing of personal data has ended, but only as long as no other retention periods are defined in legislation, for example, retention periods for financial documents. Legal requirements in certain scenarios or countries also often require blocking of data in cases where the specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes for the processing of this data have ended, however, the data still has to be retained in the database due to other legally mandated retention periods. In some scenarios, personal data also includes referenced data. Therefore, the challenge for deletion and blocking is first to handle referenced data and finally other data, such as business partner data.



## Deletion of Personal Data

The processing of personal data is subject to applicable laws related to the deletion of this data when the specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for processing this personal data has expired. If there is no longer a legitimate purpose that requires the retention and use of personal data, it must be deleted. When deleting data in a data set, all referenced objects related to that data set must be deleted as well. Industry-specific legislation in different countries also needs to be taken into consideration in addition to general data protection laws. After the expiration of the longest retention period, the data must be deleted.
