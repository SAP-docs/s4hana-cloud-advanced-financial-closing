## About SAP Advanced Financial Closing

SAP Advanced Financial Closing supports you in planning, processing, monitoring, and analyzing financial closing tasks for the entities of your group. For more information about using the functions and features provided, see the [user guide](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b3f5b9cf1ab7498fad5b6f297013d65a/SHIP/en-US/239ab375e0334c149082cc6851644e8b.html "Provides details about the changes made in each version of this document.") :arrow_upper_right:.

SAP Advanced Financial Closing is an SAP BTP application that runs in an SAP BTP subaccount. The SAP BTP subaccount is associated with an SAP BTP global account. Your organization may have several SAP BTP global accounts. Please clarify with your sales representative in which SAP BTP global account your entitlement to SAP Advanced Financial Closing should be contained. If you have no previous SAP BTP global account, a new one needs to be created. Your sales representative will assist you.

The following graphic shows a high-level architecture. The solution is an application on SAP BTP in the Cloud Foundry environment, which you can connect to SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP S/4HANA, or SAP ERP as your financial communication systems. The integration scenario to SAP systems uses OData services for SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP S/4HANA systems, and a REST service for SAP ERP systems. SAP HANA is used as a database, and attachments are stored in the Object Store on SAP BTP. You must have an identity provider \(IdP\) to be able to configure your user management.

                                                  Closing back end, the SAP HANA database, as well as the object store on SAP BTP: Either an SAP IdP or a customer IdP serves as entry
							point to the SAP Advanced Financial
                                                  Closing back end. The system’s front end, back
							end, and databases are part of the SAP BTP subaccount for the
							Cloud Foundry environment on SAP side. The SAP HANA database
							and the object store on SAP BTP form the database component.
							The front end is represented by the SAP Fiori UI. The SAP Advanced Financial
                                                  Closing
							back end has two communication channels: one with SAP S/4HANA Cloud on
							SAP side and one with the customer’s SAP BTP subaccount. The
							customer’s SAP BTP subaccount contains three components:
							subscription to SAP Advanced Financial
                                                  Closing, security controlled through roles and
							role collections, and the connectivity component represented by destination service and cloud connectors. This
							connectivity component is connected to the customer’s SAP S/4HANA or SAP ERP system. Some of the graphic's areas are interactive and
